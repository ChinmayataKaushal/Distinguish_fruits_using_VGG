Kaggle's Fruits360 is a project in which the model classifies an image of a fruit into one of the 120 classes. 
In this we used pretrained VGG model for better results.

I have uploaded the python file for everyone to read the code. 
But I have also uploaded the .ipynb file if you're interested to see the working model on Google colab.

I picked up the dataset from this link ~ https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits.
